# Eigenvalues Calculations by Matrix Diagonalization with Householder Transformation and Gaussian Elimination

## Description

This project demonstrates matrix diagonalization techniques in Python, focusing on:
- **Householder Transformation**: Reducing a symmetric matrix to tridiagonal form.
- **Gaussian Elimination**: Diagonalizing the tridiagonal matrix for further analysis.

The script is modular, ensuring each function serves a specific purpose, making it easier to understand and extend.

## Features

- Generates random symmetric matrices.
- Tridiagonalizes symmetric matrices using Householder transformations.
- Diagonalizes tridiagonal matrices via Gaussian elimination.
- Handles edge cases for numerical stability.

## Files
- **matrix_operations.py**: Contains all functions and the main script logic.
